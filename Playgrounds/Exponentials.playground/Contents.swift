## Exponentials

[Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_object)

We'd like to *extract* a method from an instance of a class and create a pure function out of it: that's called *method reference*, and it's the same concept of *exponential object* in category theory.

The point is, we want to extract the method from the class itself (so we don't need to have a particulat instance around), then create the actual exponential by passing this method a concrete instance of class: this means that we are creating a *parametric method reference*, where the parameter is the instance itself.

/*:
This doesn't work properly in Swift for methods that have a Void input, because we're going to produce a function of type:

`A -> () -> B`

But what we really want is a function of type:

`A -> B`

So to make this work we need a higher-order function of type:

`(A -> () -> B) -> (A -> B)`

We're sure this can be implemented, because this means (thanks, [Curry-Howard isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curryâ€“Howard_correspondence)):

`(P => (false => Q)) => (P => Q)`

but

`(false => Q) => Q`

thus, we get a tautology.
