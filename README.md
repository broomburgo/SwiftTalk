Mathematical & Programming ideas, translated to Swift.

Most of the ideas are renderend in Swift [playgrounds](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/Playground_Help/Chapters/AboutPlaygrounds.html).

In category theory, [exponential objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_object) are *parametric morphisms* in which the "parameter" is an object of a certain category.

In object-oriented programming, exponential objects are defined as **method references**, that is, functions "extracted" from objects, in which the deriving instance is a local parameter of the function.
