## SwiftTalk

Mathematical & Programming ideas, translated to Swift.

Most of the ideas are renderend in Swift [playgrounds](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/recipes/Playground_Help/Chapters/AboutPlaygrounds.html).

#### [Exponentials](/Playgrounds/Exponentials.playground/Contents.swift)

In category theory, [exponential objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_object) are *parametric morphisms* in which the "parameter" is an object of a certain category.

In object-oriented programming, exponential objects are defined as **method references**, that is, functions "extracted" from classes, in which the first function's parameter is an instance of that class.

#### [The Road to Monad](/Playgrounds/TheRoadToMonad.playground/Contents.swift)

Based on [Brian Beckman](https://twitter.com/lorentzframe)'s [Don't fear the Monad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8).

Let's build a Monad, starting from the simple, basic need of *function composition*.

#### [Primitive Recursion](/Playgrounds/PrimitiveRecursion.playground/Contents.swift)

Based on the first part of [this lesson](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cdm/pdf/PrimRec-6up.pdf).

A introduction to primitive recursion, a.k.a., a way to build recursive functions on natural number by using basic functions and tools.

#### [All About Monads](/Playgrounds/AllAboutMonads.playground/Contents.swift)

An opinionated translation into Swift of [this famous Haskell tutorial](https://wiki.haskell.org/All_About_Monads).
